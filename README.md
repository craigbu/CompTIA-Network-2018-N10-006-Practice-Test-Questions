Network+ (Network Plus) is a mid-level certification for network technicians. This certification is designed to test the competency of a mid-level network technician in supporting and configuring <a class="kbh" title="" href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/abkr">TCP/IP</a> clients in terms of network design, cabling, hardware setup, configuration, installation, support, and troubleshooting.

The Network+ certification is sponsored by <a title="" href="http://www.comptia.org/home">CompTIA</a>, which is the Computing Technology Industry Association (formerly ABCD: The Microcomputer Industry Association).

The Network+ exam contains situational, traditional, and identification types of questions. The Network+ exam is open to anybody, although it is designed to be taken by those with at least 18 months of on-the-job experience as a network technician, as well as the A+ certification or equivalent knowledge.

The Network+ exam tests the ability of a networking technician to install, maintain, troubleshoot, and support a network, and understand various aspects of networking technologies, including TCP/IP and the OSI model. It also tests knowledge of network components and where they function in association with the OSI model, network cabling, network security, and network troubleshooting. People who took the test before December 31, 2010 retain certification for life; those receiving certification January 1, 2011 or later need to reobtain certification after three years.

CompTIA also sponsors certification for document imaging (Certified Document Imaging Architech [CDIA]) and a hardware certification exam (A+). The CompTIA certifications are usually more basic and less product-specific than other certifications, such as Microsoft's MCSE or a Novell CNE.

You can take the Network+ certification exam, as well as exams for many other certifications, at a number of testing centers around the world
